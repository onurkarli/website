        <h1>Onur Karlı</h1>
        <h5>Electrical Automation Engineer</h5>
        <p>My work experience is focused on Factory Automation. I have 9 years of work experience in totality.
            In addition to my education and work experience, I have always set out to improve myself. For this reason, I have extensively attended courses on coding and computer science during Coronavirus Pandemic.
            Good engineers do their job well, but perfect engineers always set out to improve themselves. I am also well versed in future concepts of engineering and my experience in Factory Automation will prove very useful during the leap towards Industry 4.0.</p>
